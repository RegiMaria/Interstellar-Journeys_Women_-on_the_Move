**PROJECT: INTERSTELLAR JOURNEYS: WOMEN ON THE MOVE**

**OBJECTIVE:**

This dataset, titled **"Interstellar Journeys: Women on the Move"** provides insights into the experiences of women as interstellar travelers. Based on the "Interstellar Travel Customer Satisfaction Analysis" dataset, it reveals how women are increasingly taking up space in society, transcending the traditional roles of mother and homemaker to become researchers and even colonizers of new worlds. The main goal of this dataset is to identify the occupations and key interests of women in interstellar travel, analyze and expand the range of experiences so that these consumers can find services that offer freedom, comfort, and independence. This contributes to building a trusting relationship between the female audience and travel agencies.
